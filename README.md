# **Adamur Backend User System**

This project is a backend service designed to handle essential user management functionalities, such as account creation, secure logins, email verification using OTP, and password recovery. Built to integrate seamlessly into platforms like **Adamur**, which supports tech education in Africa, this API emphasizes security, scalability, and flexibility.

## **Overview of Features**

- **User Registration**
  - Users can sign up by providing their email and a secure password.
  - Passwords undergo strong encryption before being saved.
  - Validates email format and password complexity for added security.
  - Sends a unique one-time verification code (OTP) to the userâ€™s email for account activation.

- **Login and Authentication**
  - Authenticates users with a secure email and password combination.
  - Issues a **JWT token** to maintain session security upon successful login.
  - Ensures that unverified users cannot log in until their email is verified.

- **Email Verification**
  - After signing up, the user receives an OTP through email.
  - The OTP is required to complete the account verification process, ensuring the user has access to the provided email.

- **Password Recovery**
  - Users can request a password reset link if they forget their password.
  - A secure token is generated and sent via email, allowing users to set a new password.

## **Tech Stack and Tools**

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js and Express for the server-side logic.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible querying and interaction with the API.
- **Database**: Prisma ORM integrated with PostgreSQL for efficient data storage (SQLite for local development).
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely manage user sessions.
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer configured with an SMTP service to handle email notifications.
- **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit tests and Supertest for API integration tests.
